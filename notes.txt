A 12â€“16 character random password + PBKDF2 200k iterations is very safe for personal use (effectively unbreakable for decades)

general command to encrypt a file
  openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -in "original/photo.jpg" -out "encrypted/photo.jpg.enc"

to encrypt new photos added in 'original' folder
  ./scripts/encrypt_files.sh

first encrypt, then commit
